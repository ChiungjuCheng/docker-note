To run an interactive session with a running Docker container we use the docker exec command with the -i and -t flags, or -it for shorter. The -i flag allow us to interact with the container, while the -t flag is used to open a terminal into the container.
The -i flag, or --interactive, instructs Docker to keep STDIN open allowing you to continuously interact with the container.
The -t flag, or --tty, allocates a pseudo-TTY which creates the terminal shell.
